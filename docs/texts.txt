--[[TEXT WIDGET v1.42 by Wlourf 07 Feb. 2011

This widget can drawn texts set in the "text_settings" table with some parameters
http://u-scripts.blogspot.com/2010/06/text-widget.html

To call the script in a conky, use, before TEXT
	lua_load /path/to/the/script/graph.lua
	lua_draw_hook_pre main_graph
and add one line (blank or not) after TEXT

The parameters (all optionals) are :
text        - text to display, default = "Conky is good for you"
              it can be used with conky variables, i.e. text="my cpu1 is ${cpu cpu1} %")
            - coordinates below are relative to top left corner of the conky window
x           - x coordinate of first letter (bottom-left), default = center of conky window
y           - y coordinate of first letter (bottom-left), default = center of conky window
h_align		- horizontal alignement of text relative to point (x,y), default="l"
			  available values are "l": left, "c" : center, "r" : right
v_align		- vertical alignment of text relative to point (x,y), default="b"
			  available values "t" : top, "m" : middle, "b" : bottom
font_name   - name of font to use, default = Free Sans
font_size   - size of font to use, default = 14
italic      - display text in italic (true/false), default=false
oblique     - display text in oblique (true/false), default=false (I don' see the difference with italic!)
bold        - display text in bold (true/false), default=false
angle       - rotation of text in degrees, default = 0 (horizontal)
colour      - table of colours for text, default = plain white {{1,0xFFFFFF,1}}
			  this table contains one or more tables with format {P,C,A}
              P=position of gradient (0 = beginning of text, 1= end of text)
              C=hexadecimal colour
              A=alpha (opacity) of color (0=invisible,1=opacity 100%)
              Examples :
              for a plain color {{1,0x00FF00,0.5}}
              for a gradient with two colours {{0,0x00FF00,0.5},{1,0x000033,1}}
              or {{0.5,0x00FF00,1},{1,0x000033,1}} -with this one, gradient will start in the middle of the text
              for a gradient with three colours {{0,0x00FF00,0.5},{0.5,0x000033,1},{1,0x440033,1}}
			  and so on ...
orientation	- in case of gradient, "orientation" defines the starting point of the gradient, default="ww"
			  there are 8 available starting points : "nw","nn","ne","ee","se","ss","sw","ww"
			  (n for north, w for west ...)
			  theses 8 points are the 4 corners + the 4 middles of text's outline
			  so a gradient "nn" will go from "nn" to "ss" (top to bottom, parallele to text)
			  a gradient "nw" will go from "nw" to "se" (left-top corner to right-bottom corner)
radial		- define a radial gradient (if present at the same time as "orientation", "orientation" will have no effect)
			  this parameter is a table with 6 numbers : {xa,ya,ra,xb,yb,rb}
			  they define two circle for the gradient :
			  xa, ya, xb and yb are relative to x and y values above
reflection_alpha    - add a reflection effect (values from 0 to 1) default = 0 = no reflection
                      other values = starting opacity
reflection_scale    - scale of the reflection (default = 1 = height of text)
reflection_length   - length of reflection, define where the opacity will be set to zero
					  calues from 0 to 1, default =1
skew_x,skew_y    - skew text around x or y axis
draw_me     - if set to false, text is not drawn (default = true or 1)
              it can be used with a conky string, if the string returns 1, the text is drawn :
              example : "${if_empty ${wireless_essid wlan0}}${else}1$endif",



v1.0	07/06/2010, Original release
v1.1	10/06/2010	Add "orientation" parameter
v1.2	15/06/2010  Add "h_align", "v_align" and "radial" parameters
v1.3	25/06/2010  Add "reflection_alpha", "reflection_length", "reflection_scale",
                    "skew_x" et "skew_y"
v1.4    07/01/2011  Add draw_me parameter and correct memory leaks, thanks to "Creamy Goodness"
                    text is parsed inside the function, not in the array of settings
